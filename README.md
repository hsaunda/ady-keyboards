# ady-keyboards
We decided to go with the Russian keyboard, since this is the standard orthography for Adyghe anyways, and the primary language spoken alongside Adyghe in Adyghe-speaking regions. We settled on a combination of the Apple QWERTY-based Russian keyboard and the standard Russian keyboard with some modifications. To make this keyboard more practical, we moved characters that are rarely used or only used in Russian loanwords to the periphery. For instance, we added the special character palochka (ӏ) to the center of the keyboard, with the most common Adyghe vowel, represented by the Cyrillic letter э, right next to it. We also moved the characters ь and ъ, very common in Adyghe, to more accessible positions on the keyboard. The Russian characters ю and ё, rarely used except in loanwords, have been moved to AltGr keys. We hope that the Russian keyboard in a layout similar to the Latin keyboard will help Adyghe speakers who also speak languages with Latin orthographies or who wish to also employ the Adyghe Latin transliteration.
We have done our best to make a keyboard that is useful and accessible with the resources that we have, and we can only hope that it will one day be put to some good use by the members of the Circassian/Adyghe community.
